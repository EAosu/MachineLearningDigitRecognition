# MachineLearningDigitRecognition
Digits feature engineering used for the sake of dimensionality reduction.
The hand written digits are given as input from sklearn data sets library.
We use  logistic regression models a vector of features,
each vector element is the return value of a feature function which recieved the image matrix as input.
Afterwards we plot features and combination of features to give an example of the feature's donation to the
classification quality.
and the final step is printing some metrics such as confustion matrix and more.
