# Machine Learning Handwritten-Digits Recognition model
<h3>Written by Nadav Malul and Ely Asaf </h3>
<p>Digits feature engineering used for the sake of dimensionality reduction.</p>
<p>The hand written digits are given as input from sklearn data sets library.</p>
<p>We use  logistic regression models a vector of features</p>
<p>each vector element is the return value of a feature function which recieved the image matrix as input. </p>
<p>Afterwards we plot features and combination of features to give an example of the feature's donation to the </p>
<p>classification quality. and the final step is printing some metrics such as confustion matrix and more.  </p>
