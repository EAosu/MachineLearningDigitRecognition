# Machine Learning Handwritten-Digits Recognition
<h3>Written by Nadav Malul and Ely Asaf </h3>
<p>Used a map data structure to easily add and remove different features.</p>
<p>Manualy writing digit features for the sake of dimensionality reduction.</p>
<p>The hand written digits used from sklearn data sets library.</p>
<p>From the input, we make a map with all features, so that each entry is a feature
vector.</p>
<p>each vector element is the return value of a feature function which receives the image matrix as input. </p>
<p>To show the feature's quality and donation to the classification proccess, </p>
<p>we plot graphs of features and combination of features. At last, we print some metrics such as a confustion
matrix to show the classification made.</p>
